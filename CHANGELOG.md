# 1.2.1 - Some bug fixes #
###### Released Aug 6, 2016 ######

* Fixed an issue where Garin's Grave and Tantegel Basement weren't randomized
* Moved "speed hacks" option to a top level question.

###### Released Aug 5, 2016 ######

* Tantegel Castle is no longer confined to its original zone from the vanilla game. Zone 0 will be moved to accomodate.

* Werewolves will now give 95 XP and 155G instead of 120/185. This also matches values from the GBC/SNES release.

Some refinement to growth curves

* Specifying --ips on the command line will still generate this file



# 1.1.1 - Fixed a crash #
###### Released Jun 7, 2016 ######

# 1.0-rc2 - Minor bug fixes and tweaks #

What's New?

* Added a new exit from the Tantegel throne room. Now you can die even faster!
* Moved the maximum spell level in ultra to 16 from 20. Too many grindfests resulted from learning HEALMORE at 20.

# 1.0-rc1 - 1.0 Release Candidate 1! Randomly Generated Map and More! #
###### Pre-release - Released Jan 12, 2016 ######

Generated Overworld!

* A new overworld map can be generated with each seed. This is enabled by default
* The enemy for forced encounters are now randomized in ultra mode. Also, on generated maps, the golem encounter is moved into Charlock's Throne Room (kind of a miniboss guarding Dragonlord).

No more command line needed!

* When the randomizer is run without options (or drag and drop), you will be prompted for options, removing the need to run from the command line to customize options.

Other stuff...

* Random enemies in Charlock are now limited to Werewolf and above for ultra mode (it was too easy).
* The token location (or whatever replaces it) is now randomized. An NPC in Cantlin will tell you where it is.
* Fixed a grammatical error which has irritated me since 1989.



# 0.9.6 - Ultra Rando Mode Engage! #
###### Pre-release - Released Dec 28, 2015 ######

New Ultra Rando Mode!

* New options for a "no holds barred" approach to player growth, enemy spells,
    enemy zones, and spell learning. This makes them (almost) completely random.

    to no tougher than scorpions.

This version also includes minor tweaks to zone randomization in normal mode.
